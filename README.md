# NixHardwareWoes
Personal repo for keeping track of fixes I've had to apply to various hardware running linux.

I'll try to make writeups for whatever I run into.
Mostly that will be specific Distros only as well.

I won't try to be a puritan and only include free software: I just want everything to work, that's it.

Macbook air 2015 (MacbookAir7,2) - Fedora 39 
post-install from this github;

```
curl -s ... | sudo bash
```
